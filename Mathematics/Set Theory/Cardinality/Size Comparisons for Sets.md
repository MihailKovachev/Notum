>We say that:

>- the [cardinality](Cardinality.md) of $A$ is **less than or equal** to the [cardinality](Cardinality.md) of $B$, written as $|A| \le |B|$, if there is an [injection](../../Analysis/Functions/Injection,%20Surjection,%20Bijection.md) between $A$ and $B$;
>- the [cardinality](Cardinality.md) of $A$ is **less than** the [cardinality](Cardinality.md) of $B$, written as $|A| \lt |B|$, if there is an [injection](../../Analysis/Functions/Injection,%20Surjection,%20Bijection.md) but no [bijection](../../Analysis/Functions/Injection,%20Surjection,%20Bijection.md) from $A$ to $B$.
