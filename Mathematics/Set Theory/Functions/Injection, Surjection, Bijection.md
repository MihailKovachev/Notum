>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Injection
>A [function](Function.md) $f: X \to Y$ is called **injective** if for each $y \in Y$ there is only one $x\in X$ such that $y = f(x)$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Surjection
>A [function](Function.md) $f: X \to Y$ is called **surjective** if its [image](Function.md) and [codomain](Function.md) are equal, i.e. for each $y \in Y$ there is at least one $x \in X$ such that $y = f(x)$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Bijection
>A [function](Function.md) $f: X \to Y$ is called **bijective** if it is both [injective](Injection,%20Surjection,%20Bijection.md) and [surjective](Injection,%20Surjection,%20Bijection.md).
