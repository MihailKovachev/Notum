>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Function
>A **function** $f: D \to C$ from a [set](../Set.md) $D$ to a [set](../Set.md) $C$ is any [right-unique](../Relations/Right-Unique%20Relation.md) [relation](../Relations/Relation.md) $f \subseteq D\times C$.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>A function $f$ is just a rule which to each $x \in D$ assigns a single $f(x) \in C$.
>>
>>
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Domain of a Function
>>The set $D$ is called the **domain** of $f$.
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Codomain of a Function
>>
>>The set $C$ is called the **codomain** of $f$.

>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Image of a Function
>>
>>The **image** $f(D)$ of $f$ is the set of all $y \in C$ for which there is at least one $x \in D$ such that $y = f(x)$.
>>
>>$$f(D) \overset{\text{def}}{=} \{f(x) \mid x \in D\}$$
>>
>>Essentially, the image is the set of all values that $f$ can produce.
