>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Metric Space
>A **metric space** is a [set](../../Set%20Theory/Set.md) $M$ equipped with a [real-valued function](Real%20Analysis/Functions/Real-Valued%20Function.md) $d: M \times M \to \mathbb{R}$ which has the following properties for all $x, y, z \in M$.
>1. Identity of indiscernibles: $d(x, y) \ge 0$ with $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$
>2. Symmetry: $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
>3. Triangle inequality: $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z)$
