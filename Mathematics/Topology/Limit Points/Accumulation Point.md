>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [topological space](../Topological%20Space.md) and let $S$ be a [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) of $X$.
>
>A point $x \in X$ is an **accumulation point** of $S$ if every [open subset](../Open%20Subset.md) $O$ which contains $x$ also contains at least one point of $S$ different from $x$.
