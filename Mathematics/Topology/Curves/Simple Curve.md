>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Simple Curve

>A [curve](Curve.md) is **simple** if for all of its [parameterisations](../../../Analysis/Vector%20Analysis/Curve%20Parameterisation/Curve%20Parameterisation.md) $\gamma: [a;b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ there exist no $t_1 \ne t_2$ such that $\gamma (t_1) = \gamma (t_2)$.

>>Intuitively, this just means that the curve does not intersect itself anywhere.
