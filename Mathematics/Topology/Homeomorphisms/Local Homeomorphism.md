>A **local homeomorphism** is a [function](../../Analysis/Functions/Function.md) $f: X \to Y$ such that every $x \in X$ has an [open](../Open%20Subset.md) [neighbourhood](../Neighbourhoods.md) $O$ and the [restriction](../../Analysis/Functions/Restriction.md) $f\big|_O$ is a [homeomorphism](Homeomorphism.md) between the [subspace](../Topological%20Subspace.md) $O$ and some open subspace of $Y$.
