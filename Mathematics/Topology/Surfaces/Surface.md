>A **surface** $\mathcal{S}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [subset](../../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) of the [real vector space](../../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20&%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Structure%20of%20the%20Real%20Vector%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$ for which there is a [function](../../../Analysis/Vector%20Analysis/Surface%20Parameterisations/Surface%20Parameterisation.md) $\phi: D \to \mathbb{R}^n$ on an [open subset](../Metric%20Spaces/The%20Metric%20Topology.md#^opensets) $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ whose [image](../../../Set%20Theory/Functions/Function.md) is $\mathcal{S}$.

>The function $\phi$ is called a **parameterisation** of $\mathcal{S}$.
