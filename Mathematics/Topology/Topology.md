>A **topology** on a [non-empty](../../Set%20Theory/The%20Empty%20Set.md) [set](../../Set%20Theory/Set.md) $S$ is a [set system](../../Set%20Theory/Set%20Systems/Set%20System.md) $\tau$ of [subsets](../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) of $S$ which has the following properties:
>
>- The [empty set](../../Set%20Theory/The%20Empty%20Set.md) $\varnothing$ and $S$ are in $\tau$.
>- The [union](../../Set%20Theory/Set%20Systems/Union%20of%20a%20Set%20System.md) of any subset of $\tau$ is in $\tau$.
>- The [intersection](../../Set%20Theory/Set%20Systems/Intersection%20of%20a%20Set%20System.md) of any subset of $\tau$ is in $\tau$.

>>[!EXAMPLE]-
>>
>>Consider the sets $S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ and $\tau = \{\varnothing, S, \{1\}, \{3,4\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{2,3,4,5,6\}\}$. The set $\tau$ is a topology on $S$, since it satisfies the requirements in the definition.
