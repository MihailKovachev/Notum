>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [topological space](Topological%20Space.md) and let $S$ be a [subset](../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) of $X$.
>
>A **boundary point** of $S$ is a point $s \in S$ such that every [neighbourhood](Neighbourhoods.md) of $s$ contains at least one point of $S$ and at least one point of its [complement](../Set%20Theory/Complement.md) $X \setminus S$.
