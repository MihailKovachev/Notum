>Let $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be [topological spaces](../Topological%20Space.md).
>
>If $(X,\tau_X)$ is [compact](Compactness.md#^compactness-of-a-topological-space), then its [image](../../Analysis/Functions/Function.md) $f(X)$ under every [continuous function](../Continuity/Continuity.md) $f: X \to Y$ is also [compact](Compactness.md#^compactness-of-a-subset).
