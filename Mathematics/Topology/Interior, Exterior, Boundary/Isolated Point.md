>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Isolated Point
>
>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [topological space](../Topological%20Space.md) and let $S$ be a [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) of $X$.
>
>A point $p \in S$ is an **isolated point** of $S$ iff $p$ has a [neighbourhood](../Neighbourhoods.md) $N$ which does not contain any other points of $S$.
>
>$$N(p) \cap S = \{p\}$$
