>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Exterior is Closed

>The [exterior](Exterior.md#^exterior) $\operatorname{Ext} S$ of each [subset](../../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) $S \subseteq X$ is [closed](../../Topologies/Closed%20Subset.md).

>>[!PROOF]-
>>
>>The [exterior](Exterior.md) of $S$ is the [complement](../../../Set%20Theory/Complement.md) of its [closure](../Closure.md) and since the [closure](../Closure.md) is a [closed set](../../Topologies/Closed%20Subset.md), the [exterior](Exterior.md) is [open](../../Topologies/Open%20Subset.md).
