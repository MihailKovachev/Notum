>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Differentiable Curve

>A **differentiable curve** is a [curve](Curve.md) which has a [differentiable parameterisation](../../../Analysis/Vector%20Analysis/Curve%20Parameterisations/Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Curve%20Parameterisations.md).

>>[!WARNING]
>>
>>Not all parameterisations of a differentiable curve are differentiable. However, when one speaks about a parameterisation of a differentiable curve, they usually mean a differentiable parameterisation.
