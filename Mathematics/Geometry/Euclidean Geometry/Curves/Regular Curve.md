>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Regular Curve
>
>A **regular curve** is a [differentiable curve](Differentiable%20Curve.md) which has a [differentiable parameterisation](../../../Analysis/Vector%20Analysis/Curve%20Parameterisations/Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Curve%20Parameterisations.md) $\gamma: I \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ whose [derivative](../../../Analysis/Vector%20Analysis/Curve%20Parameterisations/Differentiation/Differentiability%20of%20Curve%20Parameterisations.md) is never zero.
