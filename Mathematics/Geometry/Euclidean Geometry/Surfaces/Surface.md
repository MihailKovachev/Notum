>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Surface

>A **surface** $\mathcal{S}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [geometric figure](../../Geometric%20Figure.md) for which there exists a [function](../../../Analysis/Vector%20Analysis/Surface%20Parameterisations/Surface%20Parameterisation.md) $\phi: D \to \mathbb{R}^n$ on a [connected](../../../Topology/Connected%20Set.md) [open subset](../../../Topology/Metric%20Spaces/The%20Metric%20Topology.md#^opensets) $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ whose [image](../../../Analysis/Functions/Function.md) is $\mathcal{S}$.
>
>The function $\phi$ is called a **parameterisation** of $\mathcal{S}$.

>>Oftentimes, the surface $\mathcal{S}$ and its parameterisations are both referred to as "surface".
