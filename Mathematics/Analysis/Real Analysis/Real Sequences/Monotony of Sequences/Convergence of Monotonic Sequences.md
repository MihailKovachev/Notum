>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Convergence of Monotonic Sequences
>An [increasing](../../Functions/Monotony/Monotony%20of%20Real-Valued%20Functions.md) [sequence](../Real%20Sequence.md) is [convergent](Convergence%20of%20Monotonic%20Sequences.md) if and only if it is [bounded above](../../Functions/Function%20Bounds.md).
