>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Real Sequence
>A **real sequence** is a [real-valued function](../Functions/Real-Valued%20Function.md) $a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ from the natural numbers to the real numbers.

>>[!NOTATION]
>>A sequence is usually denoted by $(a_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ or just $(a_n)$. The value of a sequence for a particular $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is usually written as $a_k$ instead of $a(k)$.
