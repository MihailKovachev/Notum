>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Definite Integral

>The **definite integral** of a [(Riemann-)integrable](Definite%20Integrals/(Riemann-)Integrability.md) [real function](../../Functions/Real%20Function.md) $f: [a;b] \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is the [limit](../../Functions/Limits%20of%20Functions/Real%20Limits%20of%20a%20Function.md) of its [Riemann sums](Riemann%20Sum.md).

>$$\int_a^b f(x) \mathop{\mathrm{d}x} \overset{\text{def}}{=} \lim_{\Delta x_i\to 0}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^\ast)\Delta x_i$$

>>[!NOTE] Note: Geometric Meaning of the Definite Integral
>>
>>The definite integral of $f$ gives us the *signed* are between the $x$-axis and the graph of $f$ from $a$ to $b$ - areas above the $x$-axis are positive and areas below it are negative.
