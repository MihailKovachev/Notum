>[!THEOREM] Mean Value Theorem for Definite Integrals

>If $f$ and $g$ are [continuous](../../Functions/Continuity/Continuity.md) on the closed interval $[a;b]$ and $g(x) \ge 0$ for all $x \in [a;b]$, then their product $f \cdot g$ is [Riemann-integrable](Definite%20Integrals/(Riemann-)Integrability.md) and there is at least one $\xi \in [a;b]$ such that
