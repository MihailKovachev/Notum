>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Real Power Series
>
>A **real power series** is a [real function](../../Functions/Real%20Function.md) $f: D \subseteq \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ which can be expressed as the following [infinite series](../Infinite%20Series.md) for each $x \in D$:
>
>$$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k (x-x_0)^k$$
>
>The values $a_0, a_1, \cdots$ are the **coefficients** of the power series and the point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ is its **expansion point**.
