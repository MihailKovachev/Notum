>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Vector Function
>
>A **vector function** $f: D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a [function](../../Set%20Theory/Functions/Function.md) from a [subset](../../Set%20Theory/Subset.md) $D$ of the [real vector space](../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20&%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Structure%20of%20the%20Real%20Vector%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^m$ to the [real vector space](../../Algebra/Linear%20Algebra/Matrices/Row%20&%20Column%20Vectors/Real%20Vectors/Structure%20of%20the%20Real%20Vector%20Space.md) $\mathbb{R}^n$.

>>[!NOTATION]
>>
>>The expression $f(\vec{x})$, where $\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1 & \cdots & x_m\end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T} \in D$ can also be written as $f(x_1,\cdots,x_m)$. This is why vector functions are also called *multi-variable functions*.
