>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Group
>A **group** is a [monoid](../Monoid.md) $(G, \cdot)$ which also satisfies the existence of inverse elements: 
>- For all $a \in G$, there exists $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element of the monoid.

>>[!NOTATION]
>>There are two main types of notation used for groups:
>>- Multiplicative notation - the group operation is denoted by $\cdot$, the identity element by $1$ and the inverse of an element $g \in G$ by $g^{-1}$;
>>- Additive notation - the group operation is denoted by $+$, the identity element by $0$ and the inverse of an element $g \in G$ by $-g$.
