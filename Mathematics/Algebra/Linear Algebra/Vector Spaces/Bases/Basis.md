>A **basis** of a [vector space](../Vector%20Space.md) $(V,K,+,\cdot)$ is a [linearly independent](../Linear%20Independence.md) [spanning set](../Spanning%20Set%20(Generator).md) of $(V,K,+,\cdot)$.

>>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Uniqueness of the Basis Representation
>>
>>If $B$ is a [basis](Basis.md) of $(V,K,+,\cdot)$, then every [vector](../Vector%20Space.md) $\mathbf{v} \in V$ can be uniquely expressed as a [linear combination](../Linear%20Combination.md) of the elements of $B$.
