>>Suppose you toss a coin nine times and it lands on heads every time. What is the probability that the coin will land on heads if you throw it once more? Surely, since the coin already landed on heads so many times, it is very unlikely that it will do so again and so it will most likely land on tails, right? Wrong! The probability of it landing heads or tails is still 50/50 - the past coin throws have no effect over the future ones.
