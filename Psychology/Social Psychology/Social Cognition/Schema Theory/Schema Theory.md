>[!THEORY] Schema Theory
>
>**Schema theory** postulates that people use [schemas](Schema.md) to store and organise knowledge about their social environment and that these [schemas](Schema.md) can later influence the decisions people make.
>
>1. Schema Acquisition
>	- [Schemas](Schema.md) are created automatically, without effortful thinking.
>	- [Schemas](Schema.md) can be created either directly by experiencing or interacting with something or indirectly by obtaining second-hand information about something such as a description of the thing from another person.
>
>2. Schema [Accessibility](Accessibility.md)
>	- The extent to which a [schema](Schema.md) may influence someone's decision-making is determined by its [accessibility](Accessibility.md).
>	- The [accessibility](Accessibility.md) of a [schema](Schema.md) can be high due to repeated experiences in the past.
>	- The [accessibility](Accessibility.md) of a [schema](Schema.md) can be elevated because it is relevant to the person's current goals.
>	- The [accessibility](Accessibility.md) of a [schema](Schema.md) can be increased due to recent experiences and encounters, a process known as [priming](Priming.md).
>
>3. Schema Usage
>	- The more ambiguous a situation is, the more likely people are to avail themselves of their [schemas](Schema.md) when making decisions.
