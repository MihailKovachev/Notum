>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Availability euristic
>
>The **availability heuristic** is a [judgemental heuristic](Judgemental%20Heuristic.md) whereby a person bases their judgement on the ease with which they can recall something:
>- If we can recall many instances of something, then we tend to assume that it must happen frequently.
>- If we can recall few instances of something but they have left a lasting impression, then we again tend to overestimate how common the thing is.

>>Which job is more dangerous - being a policeman or a farmer? High-profile cases of police shootings often make it into the media and are thus likely to mislead you that the policeman's job is more hazardous. However, statistics show that fatal work injuries are twice as common in people in farming, fishing and forestry occupations. [](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf)

>>[!EXAMPLE]- Example: Car vs Plane Crashes

>>Is travelling by car or by plane safer? When a plane crashes, the news reports make a strong impression on us. However, you are almost a 100 times more likely to die in a car crash than in a plane crash. [](https://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/pressroom/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-safety/)
