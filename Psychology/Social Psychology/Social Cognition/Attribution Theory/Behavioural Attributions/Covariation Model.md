>[!THEORY] Theory: Kelley's Covariation Model
>
>[Harold Kelley](../../../../People/Harold%20Kelley.md)'s **covariation model** is the most well-known theory of how people make [behavioural attributions](Behavioural%20Attribution.md).
>
>Kelley's model postulates that three basic components are present in any [attribution](Behavioural%20Attribution.md) situation - the actor, the behaviour and the stimulus. The **actor** can respond to various **stimuli** with various **behaviours** and people want to determine the reason why the actor chose one particular behaviour over another.
>

>The model states that people use three types of information when making an [attribution](Behavioural%20Attribution.md) about the actor's behaviour:

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Consistency Information
>>
>>**Consistency information** is information about the frequency with which the actor displays *this particular* behaviour when exposed to *this particular* stimulus across different circumstances:
>>- high consistency - the actor often behaves in this way when exposed to the same stimulus, even at different times and in different circumstances;
>>- low consistency - the actor's behaviour when exposed to the same stimulus varies at different times and in different circumstances.
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Distinctiveness Information
>>
>>**Distinctiveness information** is information about the frequency with which the actor displays *this particular behaviour* when exposed to *different* stimuli:
>>- high distinctiveness - the actor often displays *this particular* behaviour when exposed to *this particular* stimulus, but rarely does so in response to other stimuli;
>>- low distinctiveness - the actor often displays *this particular* behaviour when exposed to *many different* stimuli.
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Consensus Information
>>
>>**Consensus information** is information about the frequency with which *other people* respond to *this particular* stimulus with *this particular* behaviour:
>>- high consensus - *other people* often display *this particular* behaviour when exposed to *this particular* stimulus;
>>- low consensus - *other people* rarely display *this particular* behaviour when exposed to *this particular* stimulus.

>Kelley's model postulates that people use the above information to make [attributions](Behavioural%20Attribution.md) according to the following table:

>>[!NOTE] Note: Limitations of the Covariation Model
>>
>>- The model assumes that people always attribute causes to behaviour like naïve scientists, but just because people can do so, does not mean that they actually do it on a daily basis.
>>- There is evidence that people are bad at objectively assessing consistency, distinctiveness and consensus. In fact, they tend to ignore consensus due to the
