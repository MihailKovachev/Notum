>[!THEORY] Correspondence Inference Theory
>
>[Ned Jones](../../../../People/Ned%20Jones.md)'s and [Keith Davis](../../../../People/Keith%20Davis.md)'s **correspondence inference theory** aims to explain the process of making [dispositional attributions](../Internal%20Attribution%20(Dispositional%20Attribution).md) by taking into account the following factors:
>
>- *Choice* - freely chosen behaviour is more likely to lead to a [dispositional attribution](../Internal%20Attribution%20(Dispositional%20Attribution).md).
>- *Social Desirability* - people are likely to make [internal attributions](../Internal%20Attribution%20(Dispositional%20Attribution).md) about socially undesirable behaviour, while socially desirable behaviour tells us little about someone's disposition.
>- *Idiosyncracy* - behaviour whose consequences are unique is more likely to result in a [dispositional attribution](../Internal%20Attribution%20(Dispositional%20Attribution).md) than a behaviour whose effects are common with other behaviours, too.
>- *Hedonic relevance* - if we believe the behaviour is intended to affect us in a specific way, then we are likely to make a [dispositional attribution](../Internal%20Attribution%20(Dispositional%20Attribution).md) about it.
>
>They postulate that people prefer [internal attributions](../Internal%20Attribution%20(Dispositional%20Attribution).md) over [external](../External%20Attribution%20(Situational%20Attribution).md) ones because people think that the former provide a stable cause for behaviour, thus making it more predictable. This assumption can explain the [correspondence bias](../Attributional%20Biases/Correspondence%20Bias%20(Fundamental%20Attribution%20Error).md).

>>[!NOTE] Note: Limitations of Correspondence Inference Theory
>>
>>- The model focuses on [dispositional attributions](../Internal%20Attribution%20(Dispositional%20Attribution).md) and does not really explain when and why we make [external](../External%20Attribution%20(Situational%20Attribution).md) ones.
>>- Although research provides some supporting evidence for correspondence inference theory, the model has largely fallen out of favour and has been replace by [Harold Kelley](../../../../People/Harold%20Kelley.md)' [covariation model](Covariation%20Model.md).
