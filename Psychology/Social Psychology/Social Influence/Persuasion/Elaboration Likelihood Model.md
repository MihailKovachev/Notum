>>[Attitude](../../Social%20Perception/Attitudes/Attitude.md) change is achieved via convincing arguments.

>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Peripheral Route to Persuasion
>>

>The theory also describes when people are likely to be swayed by each route:
>- If the topic is personally relevant, people likely to pay close attention to the arguments, thereby taking the central route, *but only if given the opportunity to actually do so*, i.e. people are not distracted or inhibited from the evaluation of the arguments in some other way.
>- If people are distracted or for whatever reason simply unable to scrutinise the arguments, then they are more likely to be persuaded peripherally.
