>[!THEORY] Drive Theory of Social Influence on Performance
>
>[Robert Zajone](../../../People/Robert%20Zajone.md)'s **drive theory** aims to explain when the presence of other people leads to [social facilitation](Social%20Facilitation.md) and when it leads to [social inhibition](Social%20Inhibition.md).
>
>Zajone argues that in every situation a person has a **dominant response**.

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Dominant Response
>>
>>The **dominant response** of a person is the behaviour they most commonly exhibit in a given situation.
>>
>
>The theory postulates that the presence of other people causes *arousal* which *drives* (i.e. amplifies) an individual's dominant response:
>- If the dominant response is correct, without mistakes, then this amplification results in [social facilitation](Social%20Facilitation.md).
>- If the dominant response is faulty, full of mistakes, then this amplification results in [social inhibition](Social%20Inhibition.md).

>>[!EXAMPLE]-
>>
>>Suppose you play the piano and have learnt a few pieces. There is one piece you have learnt very well and you make very few mistakes when playing it. But there is also another piece which you started learning relatively recently and you make many mistakes when playing it.
>>
>>One day, you invite some friends over, they notice your piano and ask you to play them something. Drive theory predicts that if you play the well-learnt piece, your performance will be enhanced by the presence of others and you will play it perfectly, perhaps making no mistakes at all. On the other hand, if you choose to play the newly learnt piece, then your performance will worsen due to the presence of others and you will make even more mistakes than usual, perhaps to the point of not being able to finish the piece.
