>[!THEORY] Social Impact Theory
>
>[Bibb Latané](../../../People/Bibb%20Latané.md)'s **social impact theory** aims to predict how likely people are to [conform](Conformity.md) under [normative social influence](Group%20Influence/Normative%20Social%20Influence.md). It takes three factors into account:
>
>- *Strength* - The more important the group is to the person, the more likely are they are to [conform](Conformity.md) to its [social norms](Social%20Norms.md).
>- *Immediacy* - The closer the group is to the person both spatially and temporally, the more likely the person is to give into [normative social influence](Group%20Influence/Normative%20Social%20Influence.md).
>- *Size* - The bigger the group, the stronger the [normative social influence](Group%20Influence/Normative%20Social%20Influence.md) it exerts, but the effect of each additional person diminishes rapidly. Going from 3 to 4 people makes much more of a difference than from 63 to 64.
