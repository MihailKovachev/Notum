>[!PHENOMENON] Phenomenon: Idiosyncracy Credits
>
>Repeated [conformity](Conformity.md) under [normative social influence](Group%20Influence/Normative%20Social%20Influence.md) in the past tends to grant a person the right to occasional deviations from the group's [norms](Social%20Norms.md) without serious consequences. It's as if the person received **idiosyncracy credits** which they could later exchange for non-[conformity](Conformity.md).

>>[!EXAMPLE]-
>>
>>Imagine that you and your friends have a tradition of clubbing every other week. One day though, you are just not feeling up to it or want to do something else completely, so you tell your friends that you are not going with them. This might even result in the whole thing being called off and no one going to the club that night. Nevertheless, your friends are unlikely to be really upset with you, since you have always gone clubbing with them before. Sure, they might be a bit mad, but there won't be any particularly serious consequences for you. For example, your friends will probably still invite you the next time. However, if you refuse to go with them many times, you are exhausting your idiosyncracy credits and they will eventually stop inviting you.
