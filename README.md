# What is Notum?
Notum is a collection of notes about different branches of science. The project's goal is to build a repository of notes to serve as a free educational resource for anyone who wants to self-study science or merely supplement their university / high school courses.

# How to use Notum?
Notes in Notum are stored as Markdown files, so you could theoretically read them with any Markdown editor. However, for the best experience, you should use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), since most notes rely on features specific to it, such as callouts, canvases, graphs and more. 

To use Notum:

1. Download and install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (optional, but highly recommended).
2. Clone the Notum repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MihailKovachev/Notum
```

3. Open the folder (Mathematics, Physics, etc.) you want to view as a vault in Obsidian or in your choice of Markdown editor. If using Obsidian, make sure to open each of the top folders as separate vaults in order to ensure the proper loading of plugins and themes.
4. Enjoy!

## Notum's Structure
Notes in Notum are non-linear which means that they follow no particular order. Instead, notes are highly interconnected with one another via links and you can easily hop from one note to another. This is especially useful, for example, when you are reading a note and an unknown concept pops up - simply click on it and you will be redirected to the note containing the concept's definition.

**Folders in Notum are very loosely organised - if you are trying to navigate Notum through folders, then you are doing it wrong!**

### Canvases
Arguably the best way to use Notum is via the included Obsidian canvases. Each displays notes on a 2D map with connections and groups linking related notes together to visualise the relationships between them. You can either use it as a map to get around to the notes you want or you can also directly read the notes in the canvas, thus saving yourself some mouse clicks and searching.

### Maps of Content
*Some* linearity does often come in handy, hence why Notum includes Maps of Content (MOCs) at various levels. These differ from canvases due to their plain text nature. You can think of an MOC as a "shopping list" of notes you need to read (and a suggestion about the order in which to read them) in order to learn about a specific topic.

Maps of Content can be identified by the `Index (MOC)` part of their name.
