>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Conservative Force
>
>A [force](../Force.md) $\boldsymbol{F}$ is **conservative** if it satisfies the following criteria:
>
>1. The [work](Work.md) done by $\boldsymbol{F}$ depends only on the start and end positions of the [point mass](../../Point%20Mass.md) it acts on, i.e. it is [path](../../Kinematics/Position.md)-independent.
>
>2. The [work](Work.md) done by $\boldsymbol{F}$ along any closed [path](../../Kinematics/Position.md) $\mathcal{O}$ is $0$.
>
>$$\oint_{\mathcal{O}}\boldsymbol{F} \cdot \mathop{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{r}} = 0$$
>
>3. The [force](../Force.md) $\boldsymbol{F}$ is a gradient field.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>If $\boldsymbol{F}$ satisfies at least one of these criteria, then it satisfies all of them.
