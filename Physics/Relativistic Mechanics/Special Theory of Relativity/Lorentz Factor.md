>The **Lorentz factor** $\gamma$ of two inertial frames of reference which are moving relative to one another with [speed](../../Kinematics/Translation/Speed.md) $u$ is defined as

>$$\gamma \overset{\text{def}}{=} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{u^2}{c^2}}},$$

>where $c$ is the [speed of light](../../Mechanics/Speed%20of%20Light.md).
