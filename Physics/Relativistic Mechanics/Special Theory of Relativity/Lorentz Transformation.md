>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Lorentz Transformation
>
>Suppose $S$ and $S'$ are two inertial frames of reference and $S'$ is moving relative to $S$ with [velocity](../../Kinematics/Translation/Velocity.md) $\boldsymbol{u}$.
>
>If an event happens at the point $(x,y,z)$ and time $t$ in $S$, then in $S'$ it happens at the point $(x',y',z')$ and time $t'$, where the relationship between $x,y,z,t$ and $x',y',z',t'$ is given by the **Lorentz transformation**
>
>$$\begin{bmatrix} ct' \\ x' \\ y' \\ z'\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\gamma & -\gamma\beta_x & -\gamma\beta_y & -\gamma\beta_z \\ -\gamma\beta_x & 1 + \frac{\gamma^2}{1 + \gamma} \beta_x^2 & \frac{\gamma^2}{1 + \gamma} \beta_x\beta_y & \frac{\gamma^2}{1 + \gamma} \beta_x\beta_z \\ -\gamma\beta_y & \frac{\gamma^2}{1 + \gamma} \beta_x\beta_y & 1 + \frac{\gamma^2}{1 + \gamma} \beta_y^2 & \frac{\gamma^2}{1 + \gamma} \beta_y\beta_z \\ -\gamma\beta_z & \frac{\gamma^2}{1 + \gamma} \beta_x\beta_z & \frac{\gamma^2}{1 + \gamma} \beta_y\beta_z & 1 + \frac{\gamma^2}{1 + \gamma} \beta_z^2\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}ct \\ x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix},$$

>where $\gamma$ is the [Lorentz factor](Lorentz%20Factor.md) for the two inertial frames of reference, $c$ is the [speed of light](../../Mechanics/Speed%20of%20Light.md) in a vacuum and $\boldsymbol{\beta} = \frac{1}{c} \boldsymbol{u}$.

>>The fact that $t$ and $t'$ can be different means that two events which are perceived as simultaneous in one frame of reference need not be perceived as simultaneous in the other. Moreover, the order of the events can be different depending on the frame of reference.
