>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas

>The **kinetic-molecular model** of an [ideal gas](../Ideal%20Gas.md) makes the following assumptions:
>
>>[!AXIOM] Axiom: Assumptions of the Kinetic-Molecular Model
>>
>>1. The [ideal gas](../Ideal%20Gas.md) is comprised of a very large number of identical particles, each with mass $m$, which are enclosed in a container with volume $V$.
>>2. These particles are very small compared to the size of the container and to the average distance between particles and therefore behave as [point masses](../../Point%20Mass.md).
>>3. These particles are moving constantly and occasionally [colliding elastically](../../Mechanics/Collisions/Elastic%20Collision.md) with the walls of the container.
>>4. The container walls are rigid, infinitely massive and thus unable to move.
