>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas
>
>The **kinetic-molecular model of an ideal gas** is an idealisation of gases which makes the following assumptions:

>>[!AXIOM] Axiom: Assumptions of the Kinetic-Molecular Model
>>
>>1. The gas is comprised of a very large number of identical particles, each with mass $m$, which are enclosed in a container with volume $V$.
>>2. These particles are very small compared to the size of the container and to the average distance between particles and therefore behave as [point masses](../../Physical%20Systems/Point%20Masses/Point%20Mass.md).
>>3. These particles are moving constantly and occasionally [colliding elastically](../../Mechanics/Collisions/Elastic%20Collision.md) with the walls of the container.
>>4. The container walls are rigid, infinitely massive and thus unable to move.
