>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas
>
>The [internal energy](../Internal%20Energy.md) $U$ of an [ideal gas](Kinetic-Molecular%20Model%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Gas.md) depends on the [degrees of freedom](../../Physical%20Systems/Degree%20of%20Freedom.md) $f$ of a single gas particle, the total number $N$ of particles and the [temperature](../Temperature.md) $T$ of the gas and is given by the following equation, where $k_B$ is the [Boltzmann constant](../Boltzmann%20Constant.md):

>$$U = \frac{f}{2}k_BNT$$

>>We consider only [degrees of freedom](../../Physical%20Systems/Degree%20of%20Freedom.md) which are responsible for some form of [energy](../Internal%20Energy.md):

>>- For a monoatomic gas such as helium, $f = 3$, since each particle is just a point whose [velocity](../../Kinematics/Translation/Velocity.md) has three independent components. We consider only the translational [kinetic energy](../../Mechanics/Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md), since single points cannot rotate and the [kinetic-molecular model](Kinetic-Molecular%20Model%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Gas.md) of an [ideal gas](Kinetic-Molecular%20Model%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Gas.md) is simple and does not include [potential energies](../../Mechanics/Energy/Potential%20Energy.md).
>>- For a diatomic gas such as hydrogen, $f = 5$, since each particle is represented by a molecule consisting of two atoms represented as points. There are $3$ [degrees of freedom](../../Physical%20Systems/Degree%20of%20Freedom.md) again due to the molecule's [velocity](../../Kinematics/Translation/Velocity.md) which has three independent components, but there are an additional $2$ [degrees of freedom](../../Physical%20Systems/Degree%20of%20Freedom.md) which come from the fact that the molecule has two possible axes of rotation. The axes are only two and not three, since rotation abound the line joining the two atoms is not possible - a point cannot rotate around itself.
