>[!LAW] Empirical Law: Heat Transfer
>
>Two [physical systems](../Physical%20Systems/Physical%20System.md) which are *not* at [thermal equilibrium](Thermal%20Equilibrium.md) will interact with each other and exchange [kinetic energy](../Mechanics/Energy/Kinetic%20Energy.md) until such an equilibrium is reached.

>This process is called **heat transfer** and is mediated by the flow of [heat](Heat.md) from the system with higher [temperature](Temperature.md) to the system with lower [temperature](Temperature.md).
